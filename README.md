# OPResearch
This site documents ongoing work focused on market dynamics, portfolio construction, quantitative analysis, and macroeconomic analysis. The central interest is understanding how markets behave across different environments and how systematic strategies can be designed, tested, and refined over time.Current work centers on portfolio backtesting and exploratory analysis of factors, volatility, drawdowns, and risk-adjusted performance. Projects emphasize transparency around assumptions, methodology, and limitations, with results supported by historical data and visualizations. The broader goal is to develop a clear and repeatable process for studying markets by combining theory, data, and iteration. This work is ongoing and will continue to evolve as new research is added.
